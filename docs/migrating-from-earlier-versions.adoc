= Migrating from Earlier Versions

Version 1.x of this plugin was centered around the `XjcGenerate` task, which was automatically
created only for the `main` source set.

In version 2.0, most of the configuration has moved to the `xjc` DSL block in the project or the
source set extension (properties on the source set starting with `xjc`), and XJC is enabled for all
source sets automatically. You will rarely need to touch the `XjcGenerate` task directly with the new
plugin version.

In many XJC scenarios, no further configuration is necessary at all, beyond applying the plugin and
adding a dependency to the JAXB API.

Since the interface to XJC has not changed much, the available properties have stayed mostly the
same, and it should not be difficult to figure out how to move them to the `xjc` block or the source set.
Check the <<Controlling XJC Behavior>> section for a complete list of available properties.
